Welcome the the first chapter *learning & pre reading*

The following sections provide generic information about the lab and different technologies used.

The lab set up in the beginning is very basic. Different components (like calico, services, ...) need to be deplyoed.

Everything important is stored on github:  `github repo <https://github.com/de1chk1nd/f5-k8s-istio-lab>`_

Lab related content is stored in the **lab-setup** folder. Detailed explanation will be provided in the labs later on.
