AS3 -- Config Maps Introduction
===============================

Following the *ingress* service, we can add a more customized declaration via as3.

Use this, if you need advanced features. Stick with ingress service, if you use web services and are happy with the provided annotations.
Ingress is less complex and complies more to dev ops/k8s kind workflows.
